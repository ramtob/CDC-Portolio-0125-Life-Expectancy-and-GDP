# LIfe Expectancy and GDP - Codecademy Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio (external) project from Codecademy's Data Science path. The aim of the project is to implement Data Visualization techniques by applying graphs to a given dataset. The dataset provides GDP and Life Expectancy data for a number of countries within a certain range of years. I am buildling here various line plots and scatter plots in order to describe the data meaningfully and to search for relations between the variables.  

Included files are a dataset (CSV) file and a Python notebook, which contains the code and the results.

The project also requested each one to write a blog post about his project and findings. I decided to create the post by converting the Python notebook to an HTML file, and to display it via the Github Pages service. In order to do that:
* I converted the python notebook to an html file using the `nbconvert` utility. The file `build_html.bat` runs the conversion.
* I pruned from the html file the code segments and added a small css file for design. These reside in the `docs` folder.
* I enabled Github Pages for the current repository at Github.

The blog post can be viewed at the Github Pages url: https://ramtob.github.io/CDC-Portolio-0125-Life-Expectancy-and-GDP/
