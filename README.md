# LIfe Expectancy and GDP - Codecademy Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio (external) project from Codecademy's Data Science path. The aim of the project is to implement Data Visualization techniques by applying graphs to a given dataset. The dataset provides GDP and Life Expectancy data for a number of countries within a certain range of years. I am buildling here various line plots and scatter plots in order to describe the data meaningfully and to search for relations between the variables.  

Included files are a dataset (CSV) file and a Python notebook, which contains the code and the results.
